# elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is a highly available and distributed search engine. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine. Elasticsearch can be used to search all kinds of documents. The goal is to our allow tenants to use elasticsearch for any type of data retrieval. The data is index, searched, and displayed in a variety of ways for analyses. 

Elasticsearch can be deployed in cloud as both a managed service in AWS or running as EC2 instances. We support the automated deployment of both types by leveraging AWS CloudFormation templates.
